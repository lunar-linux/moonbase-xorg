cat << EOF
xf86-video-sisusb provides the X.Org video drivers for SiS (Silicon Integrated
Systems) based video chips that are connected via a Net2280 USB dongle.
The driver is not accelerated, but provides support for colordepths of 8, 16
and 24 bpp as well as Render and other extensions.
The sisusb driver supports USB video cards based on the SiS315E/PRO chipset.
The SiS315E/PRO features two CRT controllers. However, in its USB version,
only the first output, referred to as "CRT1", is being used.
