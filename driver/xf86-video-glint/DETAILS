cat << EOF
xf86-video-glint provides the X.Org video driver for the Texas Instruments/
3DLabs Glint and Permedia family of video cards. The driver is rather fully
accelerated, and provides support for the following framebuffer depths: 8, 15
(may give bad results with FBDev support), 16, 24 (32 bpp recommended, 24 bpp
has problems), 30, and an 8+24 overlay mode.
