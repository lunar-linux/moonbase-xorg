cat << EOF
xf86-video-intel provides the X.Org video driver for the Intel i8xx and i9xx
family of integrated graphics chipsets. This includes the i810, i815, i830,
i845, i855, i865, i915, i945 and i965 series chips.
The driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24. All visual types are supported in
depth 8. For the i810/i815 other depths support the TrueColor and DirectColor
visuals.
For the 830M and later, only the TrueColor visual is supported for depths
greater than 8. The driver supports hardware accelerated 3D via the Direct
Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), but only in depth 16 for the i810/i815 and
depths 16 and 24 for the 830M and later.
