cat << EOF
Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
does not depend on the X Window System.  It is designed to locate
fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
specified by applications.

This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
(fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list),
and a program to test the matching rules (fc-match). It also makes
fonts managed by defoma available to fontconfig applications.
