S3 Texture Compression (S3TC) library for Mesa.
S3TC support has been partially implemented in Mesa. However,
S3TC code can't be integrated and enabled by default due to
the patents on the algorithm. Because of this, to be cautious,
code was integrated to only attempt to open an external library,
libtxc_dxtn.so, and use a small number of functions from that
to implement S3TC if available.
