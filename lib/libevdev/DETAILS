cat << EOF
libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices. It moves the common tasks when
dealing with evdev devices into a library and provides a library interface to
the callers, thus avoiding erroneous ioctls, etc. The eventual goal is that
libevdev wraps all ioctls available to evdev devices, thus making direct access
unnecessary.
