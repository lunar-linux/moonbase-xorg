cat << EOF
Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to
that of OpenGL.

To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command
syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from
Silicon Graphics, Inc.(SGI).

mesa-lib provides libGL.so, needed for many different programs.
