cat << EOF
The XCB util modules provides a number of libraries which sit on top of libxcb,
the core X protocol library, and some of the extension libraries.
These experimental libraries provide convenience functions and interfaces which
make the raw X protocol more usable.
Some of the libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part
of the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.
