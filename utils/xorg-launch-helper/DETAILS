cat <<EOF
Xorg-launch-helper is a small utility that transforms the X server process
(XOrg) into a daemon that can be used to make applications wait with starting
until XOrg is ready for X11 connections.

The utility starts and forks the XOrg server and listens for a signal from the
XOrg server. At this point, the utility signals systemd READY through sd
notify(). At this point systemd will start units that have an explicit ordering
configured to be after the xorg.target.

This mechanism can be used to delay the starting up of services that require a
working X11 display server, such as any form of graphical process or X11 window
manager.
