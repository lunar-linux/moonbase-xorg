Xwd is an X Window System window dumping utility. Xwd allows X users to store
window images in a specially formatted dump file. This file can then be read
by various other X utilities for redisplay, printing, editing, formatting,
archiving, image processing, etc. The target window is selected by clicking
the pointer in the desired window. The keyboard bell is rung once at the
beginning of the dump and twice when the dump is completed.
