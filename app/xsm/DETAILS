xsm is a session manager. A session is a group of applications, each of which
has a particular state. xsm allows you to create arbitrary sessions - for
example, you might have a "light" session, a "development" session, or an
"xterminal" session. Each session can have its own set of applications.
Within a session, you can perform a "checkpoint" to save application state, or
a "shutdown" to save state and exit the session.
When you log back in to the system, you can load a specific session, and you
can delete sessions you no longer want to keep.
