Luit is a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a UTF-8
terminal emulator. It will convert application output from the locale's encoding
into UTF-8, and convert terminal input from UTF-8 into the locale's encoding.
An application may also request to a different output encoding using ISO 2022
and ISO 6429 escape sequences. Use of this feature is discouraged: multilingual
applications should be modified to directly generate UTF-8 instead.
